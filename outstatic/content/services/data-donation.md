## How about just asking people to give them your data?

Data donation is an exciting new paradigm for collecting personal digital trace data. People today have unprecedented access to their own traces of digital behavior due to data protection regulations such as the GDPR, that empowers them to request their data from large platforms such as Google, Meta and TikTok. The Societal Analytics Lab is involved in various initiatives (OSD2F, Digital Footprints Lab, D3I) for developing infrastructure and best practices for asking people to donate these digital traces for academic research.

If you are interested in using Data Donation in your own research, please reach out, and we can help you on your way!
