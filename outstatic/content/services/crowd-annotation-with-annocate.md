## The AnnoCate annotation software

Does your research involve manual annotation? We have developed an open-source annotation platform to make it easy to deploy annotation jobs. Our platform can be used for either expert coding, with a select group of trained coders, or crowd coding, with a large group of untrained coders. Furthermore, we are eager to experiment with innovative ways to deploy annotation tasks, including annotation experiments and guerrilla coding.

If any of this piques your interest, please reach out! For a quick demo of some of the main features supported by our tool, please try [the demo ](https://annocate.com/demo?units=introduction&codebook=introduction)(works great on mobile as well!)
