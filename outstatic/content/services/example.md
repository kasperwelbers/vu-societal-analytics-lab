## A searchable database for your text documents

Are you working with large collections of textual data, or have you at some point collected an interesting corpus that you intend to use for research, and maybe share with colleagues? We have developed the AmCAT infrastructure for storing these documents in a way that you can easily search and download them, and share them with others with fine-grained control over what content they can see.
