- At the societal analytics lab we aim to serve as a nexus for connecting various relevant skills in the area of computational analysis. If you find yourself in need of an expert opinion or support on a particular topic, please let us know. If you are a lab member and find yourself in possession of a set of skills that you believe could benefit others, please let us know.

- We maintain a repository with [R course material](https://github.com/ccs-amsterdam/r-course-material), on topics ranging from data wrangling to text analysis and advanced statistics. Feel free to use this material as you please, and to contact us for any questions or requests.
