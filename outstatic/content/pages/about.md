As we find ourselves in an increasingly digital society, the way we study social dynamics is shifting. No longer are we solely reliant on traditional methods; instead, we dive into the intriguing digital imprints left by everyday activities - from the casual tweet to the tracking of health and commercial behaviours.

Think of it this way: the Societal Analytics Research & Innovation Lab at the Faculty of Social Sciences of Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam is like your friendly neighbourhood guide in the vast realm of digital social dynamics. Whether you're a computational social scientist or just beginning your digital research journey, we're here to support and equip you with the right tools, data, and skills.

## We're here for you to:

- **Boost research funding**: let us support you in the use of innovative methodologies grounded in a solid institutional setting, for winning research proposals.
- **Enhance computational research**: benefit from essential resources to bolster research and teaching productivity.
- **Spread knowledge**: make valid and informed use of computational techniques.
- **Increase visibility and impact**: make FSS research pop with innovative data visualizations for the world to see. Plus, let's influence societal discussions through our robust research outreach.

## What we do:

- **Data Collection**: from social media footprints to other digital traces, we collect and archive them for easy access.
- **Tools & Resources**: whether it's software for manual annotation or GPU-driven computing for automatic text/image processing, we've got you covered.
- **Learning & Collaboration**: from training sessions to hackathons, we promote knowledge exchange and foster global connections.
- **Grants & Rewards**: we recognize and incentivize computational research efforts among our members, to increase the number of grants and rewards awarded to our faculty's cutting-edge research.
